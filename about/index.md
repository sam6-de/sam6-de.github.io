## Thats all about me:

Basically, I am a human (more or less) and I live in Germany. My profession is software developer.
I love to do experiments with new frameworks, concepts, etc. in my freetime. If I make mistakes or write shitty code, it is only to act more like a human.
If I am not writing code, I go hiking with my wife or drink a KÃ¶lsch with friends in cologne. Alternatively I improve my home (or my garden).
