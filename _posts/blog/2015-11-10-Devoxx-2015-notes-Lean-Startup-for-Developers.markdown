### Overview
In 2010, I was a freelance software developer, working for an eCustoms software provider. I had always wanted to create my own company but the more I learned about what seemed to be necessary to create your own business (writing a business plan, gathering 3-year projections about your market, etc.), the more I doubted my abilities to do it. And then thanks to a Startup Weekend, I discovered Lean Startup and it was a real aha moment to me. Finally something that spoke to my Agile developer's experience. Finally there was another way, a better way to create a startup, all based on experiments and iterations, minimizing waste and shipping stuff. I won the startup weekend and I took it as a wake-up call. A few weeks later, I quit my job and I started working on my first startup, Kodesk, using Lean Startup techniques extensively. I learned a lot in the process, made some mistakes, launched another project, tried to do better, didn't succeed, but yet again, improved my understanding of it. In this presentation, I'll share some of the basics of creating your startup as a bored developer, as well as my own experience with it.

###Why create your own Startup?
- NOT: it’s cool to be an entrepreneur
- Your unique million-dollar idea
- —> there is no such thing
- you want to be your own boss
- —> power comes with great responsibility
- your product will be so much better
- —> think business model instead
- somebody tould you…
- —> Scratch your own itch
- Tired of being a consultant?
- —> Beware of the pimps
- Obsessed about building a product
- —> startup is nit the best environment
- you’ve git the skills
- —> the perfect triangle
- Use your favorite technologies
- —> Over design will kill you
- Something out of your pet projects
- —> you will have to keep focus
- You might want to improve everyones live
- —> niche strategy is key
- Market research shows you the way
- —> Quality over quantity

###Good reasons:
- Invest in yourself
- find your own solutions
- Unique opportunities ant expertise
- Grow as a human being
- be a part of the solution
- choose the people you work with

###reasons against:
- You know what you have
- Not enough money set aside
- You miss some business skills
- you need to pay the bills
- you don’t have enough time
- Startups are for youngsters
- Your ideas are not good enough
- You are not in the right place
- What if I fail?

###sum-up
- the power to execute
- you already know about lean (eliminate waste)
- you are surrounded by problems
- you can easily go freelance

###Let’s create this startup together
- market study
    - questionnaires and surveys
    - Market reports
    - quantitative only
    - takes time and money
    - only valid if you want to verify a strong hypothesis
    - very long iteration cycles
    - Tends to confirm what you want to hear
- Business plan
    - takes time to write
    - long iteration cycle
    - very cumbersome to update
    - Who will read it?
    - 3-year projections are for existing business models
    - —> Hockey Stick Forecast
- incorporate
    - in Belgium you need to set aside 6000€
    - it takes about a month
    - once you are in you need an accountant and an office address
    - it costs 3000 to 4000€ to shut down
    - you’d bette be pretty sure it’s gonna be worth it
- infamous prototype
    - you gets what people are going to need
    - you guess what they are familiar with
    - you include as many features as you possibly can
    - very few of those features will actually be used
    - a lot of wasted time and effort
    - DO NOT consider that as „free effort“: opportunity cost
    - When do you stop? (afraid of showing it?)
- Non-disclosure agreement
    - you are afraid that somebody with more money will steal
    - „good“ and „original“ ideas don’t exist!
- Raise angel funding
    - angel investors are interested in
        - quality, passion, commitment, integrity
        - market opportunity and potential
        - business plan AND initial traction (are there REAL users?)
        - technology and intellectual property
        - an appropriate valuation
        - exit strategies (if not enough money, how to stop company? if much money, how to sell company?)
    - You need: an elevator pitch, a pitch deck, a prototype, …
    - But more importantly, you need introductions
- Start testing on real customers
    - build it and they will come
    - How do you measure what work and what doesn’t? (—>PIWIK, …)
    - WHAT’S YOUR LAUNCHING STRATEGY AND MARKETING BUDGET?
    - How will you cut through all the noise
    - what if it doesn’t work at all?
- Become rich!

###Lean Startup to the rescue
- You know nothing Jon Snow… ;-)
- A Startup is a learning organization
    - idea
    - build
    - product
    - measure
    - data
    - learn
    - idea
    - …
- How not to lose yourself spinning?
    - Values: who are you?
    - Mission: why do you want to do it?
    - Vision: what do you bring into the world?
- the goal is to find a business model
    - Customer (not just users/subscribers, customers are those who pay!)
    - Problem (the simpler, the better; what is THE BIG problem?)
    - Solution (it is the whole package, not only technical; how to keep customers?)

###Generic process
- Find a customer with a problem
- find a solution that solves this problem for this customer to the point he’s ready to pay
- reach product-market fit
- scale up (this is the LAST step!)

###Elevator pitch
- my company XY
- is developing YX
- to help XX
- solve YY
- with ZZ

###Company name
- don’t spend too much time on that
- start with a code name
- be pragmatic
- find a name that is available
- beware of cultural bias (audi eton -> FR?)
- think ahead, think big
- something easy to remember

###Defined Offering
- a platform is not a defined offering
- Think beyond mobile apps and websites (hammers and nails)
- „Concierge mode“ is an excellent way to learn
- Because you can doesn’t mean you should
- Mailing lists, phone numbers, forums, blogs, brick-and-mortar
- Pen and paper
- Minimum testable product (receive feedback)
- then Minimum viable product

###Target Audience
- the world is the worst starting point (start small, go through every step to build a good product)
- Quality over quantity
- Think growth strategy
- Early-vangelists
- Start with a niche
- Customers != Users
- Criteria priority:
    - pain level
    - ease of reach
    - price
    - market size

###Problem
- Customers won!t pay for a nice-to-have, only for a must-have
- Shark-bite versus mosquito-bite
- Entertainment is the only exception
- Facebook is not an exception

###Secret Sauce
- not necessarily a secret
- Difference for the sake of difference doesn’t matter
- Unique combination of ingredients
- Unique connection to its cook

###Information radiator (the lean canvas)

###How to model a business?
- Customer Segments (visualize your customer)
    - Name (e.g. Patricia)
    - behaviors (all relevant possibilities)
    - needs&goals (e.g. goals for life/day/…)
    - facts (how old/#kids/…)
- Problem
    - 3 most pressing problems (must-haves? painful?)
    - existing alternatives for each problem (how does my customer solve this problem already?)
- Unique value proposition
    - Tagline for your marketing website („this is for you, Patricia!“)
    - „X for Y“ (U-Boot for pigs)
- Solution
    - One key feature for each problem (this is the hardest part!)
- Channels
    - Awareness
    - Acquisition
    - Distribution
- Revenue Streams
    - Subscriptions
    - One-time
    - …
- Cost Structure
    - Variable vs. fixed
    - How many customer to offset costs
- Key metrics
    - how will you measure success? (Number of registered users is NOT a valid metric!)
    - (AARG?!?!)
- Unfair Advantage
    - can’t be easily copied or bought
*these points are just assumptions!!!!*

###Customer-problem experiments
- Example process
    - Brainstorm all potential niches
    - cherry pick 3 of them based on good feeling
    - Draft a lean canvas for each niche
    - Sort them by
        - customer pain level
        - ease of reach
        - Price (what will they pay)
        - market size
- Choose the first one
    - and list your hypotheses (focus on the most important things first)
    - in terms of (and ordered by)
        - who your target is
        - what his problems are
        - how they are ordered
        - what his alternatives are
- Reach out… (the user-story-writing-part)
    - Find at least 5 people to interview
    - Schedule interviews (street interviews are annoying)
- Problem interviews
    - Do not sell anything
    - Watch verbal and non-verbal answers (i think, it’s very hard, to find a appartment)
    - Always ask for referrals
- Validate hypotheses
    - Every 10 interviews
    - Adapt and iterate
    - Update your canvas (document your learnings)
- Don’t stop until
    - at least 10 persons interviewed
    - Well-defined demographics (facing product targeting)
    - Must-have problems (at least one; if you don’t have one —> Problem!)
    - Understand how customers solve problems today
- Draft a solution
    - 3 key features with pen and paper
    - pricing proposition
- Go back to your first customers (and show them)
    - and their referrals
    - see how they react to your features
- Learn and adept
    - update your canvas
    - don’t write any code
    - Landing pages are good too (easy to a/b-test)
    - coffee shop interviews
- Then start coding!

###Words to the wise
- don’t quit your job until you really have to (customer/problem)
- Don’t incorporate before you have a real business
- find yourself at least one cofounder
- Agile methodologies are a perfect fit
- Do not give shares for advice/contacts
- beware of bad investment deals
- Take all this with a grain of salt
