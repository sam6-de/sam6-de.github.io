Today it's friday, so i had time to surf around on some interesting internet pages. I love [Reddit](http://reddit.com) to see what's going on and what could be the next big thing.  

While reading the newsfeed I found [this interesting link](http://www.yacoset.com/how-to-handle-currency-conversions) describing some basic things to do (or better not to do) when you have to handle money and currency conversions.

This article is definitively worth reading!
