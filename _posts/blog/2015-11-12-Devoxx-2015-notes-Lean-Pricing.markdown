### Overview
Pricing is hard: set your price too high, and nobody will buy from you. Set it too low, and you won’t cover the costs to service your customers. Startups need to “discover” their ideal price, a process few founders are comfortable with.

In this session, you’ll learn about the economics of pricing, you’ll be presented with 11 different pricing methods, we’ll discuss freemium vs. premium and give you tons of practical pricing advice for your startup.

- pricing methods
- multi-axic s
- strategies
- free vs. paid

- higher price, less customers
- price x customers —> revenue curve middle high
    - find the optimum

###Pricing results

###A better way to determine your profit

    - variable cost
    - fixed cost

    - Profit

###Central questions
- What value?
- Why would they pay?

- Features
- Advantages
- Benefit
- The benefit of the benefit
- The pain of the pain

###Factors influencing pricing

- clients
- cost
- market

- price increase 1%
    - profit 11%

###pricing methods
- Silicon Valley rule of thumb
    - deliver 10x more value
- Customer interviews
    - price objection —> value objection
- industry benchmark
    - industry gross margins
        - software 70-90% margin
        - SAAS 60-80% margin
        - revenue of costumer = 3-4x costs of acquisition
- Break-even point
    - find the break-even point
        - revenue
        - margins
        - cost
- Google-Ads (just try out; cost of sales validation)
    - Sales funnel costs
    - conversion rates
    - lead value
- Anchoring Benchmark
    - people can only understand relative value
    - e.g. macbook 999$ —> iPad just 499$
- decoy effect
    - 8GB 25$ vs. 32GB $29 vs 64GB 39$
- Buy vs. Build psychology
    - CRM $10k vs Custom CRM $100k
        - they save $90k
- Pricing distribution fit
    - resellers
    - distributors
    - agents
    - affiliates
    - each wants to have a „slice of the cake“
- Competition
    - pricing spectrum
        - low to high
    - average pricing point
- Multi-axis pricing
    - users
    - features
    - usage
    - salesforce.com uses user limitation and features axis

###pricing strategies
- price elasticity
- discounts (never continuous, use timeframes instead, e.g. 70% during first year)
- pilot customer

Airbnb / Paypal

###The Freemium approach
- Tease
- Please
- Seize

###Final words
- the Dos
    - research the optimal price
    - Price is a continuous process
    - Understand your customers
    - Use industry gross margin as a validation point
    - Use Tactics (multiple price plans, combinations, etc.)
    - Consider Partnerships
    - start with the premium
    - offer transactional pricing to transactional business
    - Pricing is a function of marketing
    - take cash flow into account
- The Don’ts
    - set-it and forget-it
    - cut prices to sell more
    - Overestimate customer lifetime value
    - Askcliens for ballpark pricing
    - underestimate cost structure
    - use more than 3 axis for pricing
    - give unlimited disconts
    - do pilots for free
    - use freemium as a vanity metric
    - Subsidize the front side in a two-sided marked model
