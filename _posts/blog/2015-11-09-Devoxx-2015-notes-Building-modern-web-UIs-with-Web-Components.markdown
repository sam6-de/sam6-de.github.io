### Overview
This session will give you a thorough introduction into Web Components. We start by explaining the standards that form the foundation of WebComponents: Template tag, custom elements, Shadow DOM, and HTML imports. Next we will do a live coding session showing you how you can rapidly build a web application with existing Web Components from Polymer Elements and other sources and connect the application to a server. In the last section, we are going to explain how you can build your own custom components and integrate them into your application. Also we will share our experience gained while building an application with Web Components and talk about pitfalls that should be avoided when using Web Components in a real world project.
