### Overview
Have you ever used an open source project? Of course you have, but have you made any contributions yourself? Filed a bug report? Submitted a patch? Have you ever started your own OSS project, or taken a closed/private project public? What licenses should you use? How do you manage contributions? How do you support contributors and still get work done? What do you do with difficult community members? In this talk we'll go over the basics of OSS: how to get involved, how to start a project, how to manage contributions. We'll discuss project lifecycles, legal CYA tips, and how to keep projects moving. You'll see the inner workings of real OSS projects, and learn how to be a better OSS user and producer.

###Open Source
- OSS
- study, change, distribute, …
- free software
- run for any purpose, …

###Here: FOSS
- freely licensed
- change, …
- openly shared
- voluntarily improve

###Benefits to user
- cost savings
- visibility
- Empowered to make changes
- Commercial support is optional

###Open source is Winning
- [openhub.net](openhub.net)

####Open Source needs you

###Getting started
- Why?
    - huge learning opportunity
    - great resume builder
    - Community and social aspects
    - it’s great fun
- 1. Find a Project
    - a tool or library you already use
    - A technology you are interested in
    - a language you want to learn
    - a project you simply want to help
    - [lightstep.net](lightstep.net)
- 2. meet the community
    - mailing lists and forums
    - chat services like irc or bitter
    - Q/A sites like Stack Overflow
    - Social sites like LinkedIn or Facebook
- 3. Determine Needs
    - help field questions on lists, forums, irc
    - improve documentation
    - present at a con or user group
    - file bugs or submit fixes
- 4. Good bug reporting
    - clearly state expectation vs. reality
    - provide code or steps to reproduce
    - Include relevant environment details
    - respond to updates and comments
- 5. Dig Deeper
    - bug triage
    - Help guide other bug reporters
    - observe fixes for other bugs
    - Attempt your own fix

###Contributing a fix
- fear
    - i’m not good enough
    - i don’t know the best solution
    - i’ll make things worse
    - I’ll be mocked or insulted
- Bug fix types
    - behavior
    - performance
    - documentation
    - quality
- Crafting a Fix
    - modify your copy of the code
    - confirm it works as you expect
        - does it fix the issue?
        - does it pass existing tests?
    - Write a test
    - Submit fix in the open
- more patch tips
    - ask for help
    - limit changes to the actual fix
    - follow proximate coding style
    - Maintain documentation truths
    - Be patient and responsive

###Into the core - becoming a contributor
- responsibility, not a price to win
- What we look for
    - proven track record of contributions
    - sustained interests
    - Domain expertise
    - respectful member of community
- „open commit bit“
    - alternative path to core
    - one accepted patch and you’re in
    - rapidly adds new core members
- be a good committer
    - discuss nontrivial changes
    - keep the tests green
    - respect bug and patch submitters
    - always humble

####Treat bug reports as gifts.

####Assume you are wrong.

####Not all bugs are in code.

###Starting a project
- why?
    - a gap in the community
    - a tool others might find useful
    - need more resources
    - just for fun … an itch to scratch
- how to find time?
    - make it a hobby
    - prefer jobs that support OSS work
    - explain career benefits to others
    - keep projects aligned with interests
